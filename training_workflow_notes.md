# Multimodal Model Training Workflow Notes

## Framework
LLaMA-Factory

## Goal
Understand how multimodal large models are fine-tuned in real workflows.

## What I Practiced

- Installed and configured LLaMA-Factory environment
- Explored the WebUI training interface
- Learned how datasets need to be formatted for instruction tuning
- Understood training configuration options such as epochs, batch size, and learning rate
- Observed how checkpoints and logs are managed

## Key Takeaways

Even without running full training, I gained a clear understanding of how the fine-tuning pipeline works from data preparation to model adaptation.
